The USPS Simple plugin calculates rates for domestic shipping dynamically using the USPS API.


== Description ==

USPS Simple integrates the US postal domestic service as a new shipping method in WooCommerce. The plugin retrieves real-time rates through the USPS API.

By default, the plugin individually calculates the shipping price for each item in the cart, simulating separate shipments. The total price displayed to the customer is the sum of the individual item prices.

For regular-sized items, there is an option to group them based on their weight. If this feature is enabled, the dimensions of the grouped items are disregarded in the calculation.

To ensure compatibility, please set the WooCommerce currency to the US dollar and ensure that the base country is the USA.
